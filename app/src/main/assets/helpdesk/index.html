                <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is it normal to pass out semen which contains
                    blood?</a>
                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Blood in the semen is called hematospermia or hemospermia. Blood in the semen
                        can come from
                        several different sources:<br>
                        • Blood in the semen is common after medical procedures. For instance, as
                        many as four out
                        of five men may temporarily have blood in their semen following a prostate
                        biopsy.<br>
                        • It can also come from an STI (sexually transmitted infection) such as
                        gonorrhea or
                        chlamydia, or from another viral or bacterial infection. Infection and
                        inflammation are the
                        culprits behind nearly four out of every ten cases of blood in the
                        semen.<br>
                        • Procedures done as treatment for urinary problems can also cause mild
                        trauma that leads to
                        temporary bleeding. This usually disappears within several weeks after the
                        procedure.
                        Radiation therapy, vasectomy, and injections for hemorrhoids can also cause
                        blood. Physical
                        trauma to the sex organs after pelvic fracture, injury to the testicles,
                        excessively
                        rigorous sexual activity or masturbation, or other injury can cause blood in
                        the semen.<br>
                        • Infection and inflammation. This is the most common cause of blood in the
                        semen. Blood can
                        come from an infection or inflammation, in any of the glands, tubes, or
                        ducts that produce
                        and move semen from the body. These include: Prostate(the gland that
                        produces the fluid part
                        of semen), Urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen from the
                        penis),Epididymis and vas
                        deferens (tiny tube-like structures where sperm mature before
                        ejaculation),Seminal vesicles
                        (which add more fluid to the semen).</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Pulling out before the man ejaculates, known as the withdrawal method, is not
                        a foolproof
                        method for birth control. Some ejaculate (fluid that contains sperm) may be
                        released
                        before the man actually climaxes. In addition, some men may not have the
                        willpower or be
                        able to withdraw in time.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>No. Use only water-based lubricants, with condoms. Oil-based lubricants, like
                        Vaseline, can
                        weaken the condom and cause it to break.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Dual protection is defined as the simultaneous prevention of a sexually
                        transmitted infection
                        and unwanted pregnancy. This can be accomplished by the consistent use of
                        condoms alone or
                        by the simultaneous use of two methods at once, one of which must be
                        condoms.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>You cannot use two condoms at the same time. It will cause friction and
                        tearing of the
                        condoms hence no protection.</p>

                    <p>Yes, it is possible. However, psychological help is necessary as it will help

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>1. Block them from your Instagram/Snapchat. If the temptation to see if
                        they’ve been paying
                        attention to your stories is too much, just block them<br>
                        2. Create an ex-free environment. As the old adage goes: out of sight, out
                        of mind. Donate
                        or throw away anything that reminds you of your ex. It’ll feel cathartic and
                        allow you to
                        move on. But what about stuff like expensive jewelry or photos from a
                        vacation you took
                        together? Why should you have to throw away all your photos from the first
                        time you went to
                        Paris just because you took them with someone else? Good news: you don’t!
                        Burns suggests
                        creating a “breakup box” where you can put keepsakes you might want in the
                        future, but are
                        too painful to see every day.<br>
                        3. Don’t trash talk your ex too much. Sure it feels good to trash talk your
                        ex with your
                        besties, and hearing that you were better than them from the start feels
                        like a drug, but
                        don’t rely on it. Hearing your friends bring down someone who made you feel
                        shitty feels
                        like it should be justified in the grand karmic scheme of things, but your
                        health and
                        happiness need not be contingent on someone else’s pain and suffering.<br>
                        4. Learn how to productively talk about the breakup. If you feel up to it,
                        “You can ask your
                        besties to share the ways in which they didn’t think you were your best self
                        in the
                        relationship, which is not the same as unproductive ex-bashing.”<br>
                        5. Don't immediately suggest to "stay friends" — and if he/she does, tell
                        him you need to
                        think about it. This is an impulse because you don't want to seem like you
                        care too much
                        about the breakup. Because you're so chill. You're so chill that your heart
                        isn't beating.
                        and, you're dead. But truthfully, during this stilted, awkward breaking-up
                        period, it's hard
                        to tell whether you'll be able to be friends or not. Generally, one person
                        wants to be
                        friends and the other wants to be more. Gotta work that out before it can be
                        a healthy
                        friendship … if it ever can be. You're not admitting defeat by not staying
                        friends with him/
                        her.<br></p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>If your cycles are on the shorter end of the spectrum, you could have your
                        period at the
                        beginning and end of the month with no reason for concern. Your increased
                        bleeding may be
                        caused by a shorter menstrual cycle or by a health problem that causes
                        vaginal bleeding. If
                        your cycle suddenly becomes shorter, it could be due to any of the
                        following: anovulation
                        (lack of ovulation), hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, onset of menopause,
                        puberty, uterine
                        fibroids or cysts, stress, extreme weight loss or gain, birth control,
                        illness. If you
                        usually have a regular cycle, a change in your cycle — such as suddenly
                        having two periods
                        in a month — could indicate a medical condition. Some health conditions
                        cause bleeding that
                        can be mistaken for a period: Pregnancy can cause spotting. Spotting during
                        pregnancy can be
                        normal, but you should tell your doctor about any bleeding during pregnancy.
                        Sexually
                        transmitted infections can cause discharge and bleeding. Miscarriage can
                        cause heavy
                        bleeding. If you suspect you’re pregnant and begin to have bleeding similar
                        to a period,
                        call your doctor./p>

                <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How to get rid of period pain?</a>
                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>1. Eat a banana. Bananas contain potassium, which may reduce cramps, as
                        cramps could be due
                        to a potassium deficiency. Other foods that contain loads of potassium
                        include: White beans,
                        such as Adzuki, soy, or Lima beans; Leafy greens, such as spinach or kale;
                        Dried fruits,
                        such as apricots, prunes, or raisins; Fish, such as salmon, halibut, and
                        tuna. <br>
                        2. Avoid caffeine as much as possible. Having too much caffeine can make
                        your cramps worse.
                        Some sources recommend avoiding foods and drinks that contain caffeine, such
                        as coffee,
                        teas, colas, etc before and during your period. <br>
                        3. Drink (decaffeinated) chamomile tea. A recent study done by the Imperial
                        College of
                        London found that drinking German chamomile tea (also called Matricaria
                        recutita) helped
                        relieve pain caused by menstrual cramps. Chamomile contains glycine, an
                        amino acid that can
                        relieve muscle spasms. By relaxing the uterus, chamomile appears to be
                        helpful in relieving
                        cramps caused by periods. <br>
                        4.Take omega-3 fatty acids. Taking a daily fish-oil supplement — high in a
                        healthy fat
                        called omega-3 fatty acid — could help you reduce pain caused by menstrual
                        cramping. One
                        study found that women who took daily fish oil supplements had less pain
                        associated with
                        cramping than women who simply took a placebo.<br></p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>A Headaches – it seems that the increase in progesterone and the imbalance
                        between estrogen
                        and progesterone is the cause of these headaches and migraines. The decrease
                        in estrogen in
                        the luteal stage causes a decrease in magnesium. This depletion of magnesium
                        is the real
                        cause of the headache.<br><br>
                        Cramps – Abdominal and stomach cramps – these can be debilitating to the
                        point of making a
                        woman bed ridden during her cycle. Cramping is caused by spasms and
                        contractions in the
                        uterus and pelvis. The release of prostaglandins increases the intensity of
                        those spasms and
                        contractions.<br><br>

                        some also have upper back pain. The culprit here might be prostaglandins

                    What is it?</a>
                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>vaginal yeast infection, also known as candidiasis, is a common condition. A
                        healthy vagina
                        contains bacteria and some yeast cells. But when the balance of bacteria and
                        yeast changes,
                        the yeast cells can multiply. This causes intense itching, swelling, and
                        irritation.
                        Treating a vaginal yeast infection can relieve symptoms within a few days.
                        In more severe
                        cases, it may take up to two weeks. Vaginal yeast infections aren’t
                        considered a sexually
                        transmitted infection (STI). Sexual contact can spread it, but women who
                        aren’t sexually
                        active can also get them. Once you get a yeast infection, you’re also more
                        likely to get
                        another one. Vulvovaginitis is an inflammation or infection of the vulva and
                        vagina. It’s a
                        common condition that affects women and girls of all ages. It has a variety
                        of causes. Other
                        names for this condition are vulvitis and vaginitis. Many triggers can cause
                        an infection in
                        the vagina and vulval areas. The most common cause is bacteria.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>A woman normally produces a vaginal discharge that usually is described as
                        clear or slightly
                        cloudy, non-irritating, and odour-free. During the normal menstrual cycle,
                        the amount and
                        consistency of discharge can vary. At one time of the month, there may be a
                        small amount of
                        a very thin or watery discharge; and at another time, a more extensive
                        thicker discharge may
                        appear. All of these excretions could be considered normal.
                        A vaginal discharge that has an odour or that is irritating usually is
                        considered an
                        abnormal discharge. The irritation might be itching or burning, or both. The
                        itching may be
                        present at any time of the day, but it often is most bothersome at night.
                        These symptoms
                        often are made worse by sexual intercourse. It is important to visit your
                        health centre if
                        there has been a change in the amount, colour, or smell of the
                        discharge.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>A person gets HIV when an infected person's body fluids (blood, semen, fluids
                        from the
                        vagina, or breast milk) enter his or her bloodstream. The virus can enter
                        the blood through
                        linings in the mouth, anus, or sex organs (the penis and vagina), or through
                        broken skin.
                        Both men and women can spread HIV. A person with HIV can feel okay and still
                        transmit the
                        virus to others. Pregnant women with HIV also can pass the virus to their
                        babies.<br>
                        Common ways people get HIV:<br>
                        Sharing a needle to take drugs
                        Having unprotected sex with an infected person<br>
                        You cannot get HIV from:<br>
                        Touching or hugging someone who has HIV/AIDS
                        Public bathrooms or swimming pools
